# Effect Sizes
The following R function allows to compute four pairs of effect sizes, that is, Cohen’s d_s and Hedges’ g_s for between-subject design, Cohen’s d_av and Hedges’ g_av, Cohen’s d_rm and Hedges’ g_rm, and Cohen’s d_z and Hedges’ g_z for within-subject design(s). CIs can be computed according to different methods, for instance, from a noncentral t-distribution. Furthermore, CIs around each effect size can be computed with different coverage. The variance around each effect size are provided when displaying the output. This R script is highly inspired from Goulet-Pelletier and Cousineau (2018) and from Fitts (2020). This R code is actualy under modification.
