# Effect-Sizes
The following R function allows to compute four pairs of effect sizes, that is, Cohen’s d_s and Hedges’ g_s for between-subject design, Cohen’s d_av and Hedges’ g_av, Cohen’s d_rm and Hedges’ g_rm, and Cohen’s d_z and Hedges’ g_z for within-subject design(s). 95% CI can be computed according to different methods, for instance, from a non-central t distribution. The variance around each effect size as well as the correlation coefficient (for each effect size computed for a within-subject design) are provided when displaying the output. This R script is highly inspired from Goulet-Pelletier and Cousineau (2018) and from Fitts (2020).
